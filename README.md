## Description

A SvelteKit starter app with email/password login, and some other nice bells & whistles!

## Features

- Supabase Authentication ([PKCE flow](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/passwords?queryGroups=language&language=js&queryGroups=flow&flow=pkce&queryGroups=framework&framework=sveltekit))
  - Sign up/in/out
  - Change/recover password
  - Server-side redirects for protecting routes
  - hCaptcha for sign in/up (WIP)
- Drizzle + Postgres + Zod for storing additional account data
- SvelteKit SuperForms + Zod for form parsing, validation, progressive enhancement, and reactive `submitting`/`delayed` state handling
- Light/dark mode stored reactively in cookies with [`svelte-persisted-state`](https://github.com/oMaN-Rod/svelte-persisted-state)
  - Set reactively client-side
  - Set proactively server-side by transforming HTML in `hooks.server.ts` to prevent [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content)!
  - Ready to extend to store/load arbitrary site-wide settings!
- Custom site-wide reactive toast messaging system

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jacksonthall22/sveltekit-supabase
   cd sveltekit-supabase
   ```

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

1. [Create a Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/new). The free tier is fine!

1. Create a `.env` based on `.env.example` and fill in your own credentials

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

1. Push database schema to Supabase with [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)

   ```bash
   # pnpm add -g drizzle-kit@latest
   drizzle-kit generate && drizzle-kit migrate
   ```

   <sub>**Note:** `drizzle-kit push` is [currently bugged](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/3504) for RLS policies, which we use in drizzle.config.ts</sub>

1. Start your app

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

1. Navigate to [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) to see your app running!

### Other required setup

<sub>(TODO - document these better, I'm trying to remember after the fact. Feel free to open issues with any questions!)</sub>

- Start by following [these docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/passwords?queryGroups=language&language=js&queryGroups=flow&flow=pkce&queryGroups=framework&framework=sveltekit) for setting up Supabase (all code is already implemented - there are just a few things to set up in your project settings)
  - Be sure to change email templates as mentioned [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/passwords?queryGroups=flow&flow=pkce&queryGroups=framework&framework=sveltekit&queryGroups=language&language=js#resetting-a-password)
- Change `Site URL` in supabase project settings (go to `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<project_id>/auth/url-configuration`)
- There may be some problems with CORS in Supabase
- Need to make sure `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH` in `constants.ts` has pairity with Supabase settings: `Authentication > Sign In / Providers > Email > Minimum password length`
- Might need to update the redirect URL sent in change-password emails in Supabase project settings (I think after deploying to vercel, the live site might try to redirect to `localhost` still)

# Deploying to Vercel

<sub>(TODO: verify these are all the steps needed)</sub>

1. Create a new project in the Vercel dashboard

1. Install the Vercel CLI

   ```bash
   pnpm add -g vercel
   ```

1. Build

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

1. Deploy!

   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

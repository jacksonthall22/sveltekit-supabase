# Frontend Agent Notes

When editing frontend code, you MUST curl `https://daisyui.com/llms.txt` and use this documentation as a reference for how to design frontend code. **All frontend code should make use of DaisyUI in this repo.** Look for opportunities to make the most of the DaisyUI framework, including components, color scheming, etc. Consider it mission-critical to avoid reinventing the wheel and staying fully invested in DaisyUI. This will help keep our frontend code maintainable.
